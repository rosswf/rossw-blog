Follow along and be part of my journey learning all things programming, devops, homelabs & more.

I recently started taking my hobby of tinkering with (and breaking) technology a lot more seriously and have decided to write about my experiences.

I'll be writing about any projects that I'm working on and technology that interests me:

* Python
* DevOps
* Infrastructure as Code
* CI/CD
* Homelabs
* Linux
* & more

Welcome!

I recently started taking my hobby of tinkering with (and breaking) technology a lot more seriously and have decided to write about my experiences.

I'll be writing about any projects that I'm working on and technology that interests me. 
The plan is to start with two or three posts about how I definitely didn't go overkill with the hosting of this blog... You'll have to keep reading to find out more but it involves AWS, terraform and ansible.

In the meantime, please check out my [twitter](https://twitter.com/rossw_) and [github](https://github.com/rosswf).
